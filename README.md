# XPScerpto

XPScerpto is a governed sovereign cryptographic infrastructure platform.

It is designed around explicit authority, controlled module boundaries, fail-closed behavior, evidence-backed validation, and conservative claim discipline. XPScerpto is not organized as a loose collection of cryptographic utilities. It is structured as a governed platform where execution authority, validation evidence, and public claims must remain aligned.

Official project information may be available at:

```

## Current status

XPScerpto is under active sovereign validation and hardening.

This repository must not be described as production-ready unless the required validation gates prove that status through live evidence.

Conservative global claim boundaries remain in force unless the relevant acceptance gates prove otherwise:

```text
PRODUCTION_READY = NO
FULL_SANITIZER_CTEST_CLAIMED = NO
FULL_GRAPH_ACCEPTED = NO
```

Subsystem-specific boundaries remain scoped to their own gates. Examples include:

```text
FHE_PRODUCTION_READY = NO
FHE_BOOTSTRAP_COMPLETE = NO
```

These flags are not marketing language. They are claim boundaries. They protect the repository from accidental overclaim, stale evidence, partial validation, and misleading release status.

## What XPScerpto is

XPScerpto is a cryptographic infrastructure project with a governance-first architecture.

It focuses on:

- explicit execution authority;
- platform-controlled admission;
- hardware evidence and routing discipline;
- authority-routed SIMD execution;
- cryptographic domain separation;
- FHE, BFV, CKKS, and bootstrap validation discipline;
- strict module boundaries;
- fail-closed behavior;
- evidence-backed testing;
- CI validation gates;
- review and ownership discipline;
- documentation that does not outrun evidence.

The project’s engineering model is based on the principle that correctness, authority, evidence, and claims must describe the same truth.

## What XPScerpto is not

XPScerpto is not:

- a normal utility library;
- a collection of unrelated crypto snippets;
- a production-ready claim by default;
- a project where build success implies acceptance;
- a project where sanitizer configuration implies sanitizer cleanliness;
- a project where target-only success implies full graph truth;
- a project where one subsystem’s progress implies platform-wide readiness.

Every acceptance claim must be proven by the relevant gate.

## Core authority chain

The expected authority flow is:

```text
platform governance
→ platform.api
→ hardware authority
→ routing capsule
→ domain execution
→ audit and evidence
```

Domain code must not invent execution authority by probing the operating system, CPU, compiler environment, hidden runtime state, or local capability shortcuts.

A capability may exist on a machine, but that does not make it admitted execution authority.

## Core validation discipline

XPScerpto keeps validation levels separate:

```text
configure success ≠ build success
build success ≠ test success
test success ≠ sanitizer truth
target success ≠ full graph truth
subsystem success ≠ repository-wide acceptance
```

This distinction is central to the repository.

A precise partial result is acceptable. A broad claim without matching evidence is not.

- `docs/governance/decision-record-template.md`

For detailed formal sovereign security specifications, see:

```text
docs/security/README.md
```

For HW authority, intelligence, runtime, power/thermal, evidence, validation, integration, and traceability specifications, see:

```text
docs/hw/README.md
```

Root-level documents remain the repository-wide policy sources. The `docs/security/` directory provides detailed formal security specification companions and does not override root-level governance, authority, threat model, security, or validation policy.

The `docs/hw/` directory provides subsystem-level HW specifications. It does not replace root-level governance, authority, architecture, module-boundary, security, or validation policy. It specializes those rules for the HW unit.

Each document has a distinct role. They should not be collapsed into one generic README.

## Document roles

## Formal security specifications

The root-level security and authority documents define repository-wide policy.

The detailed formal sovereign security specification layer is maintained under:

```text
docs/security/
```

Start with:

```text
docs/security/README.md
```

That directory may contain canonical specification files such as:

```text
docs/security/01_threat_model.md
docs/security/02_authority_model.md
docs/security/03_capsule_specification.md
docs/security/04_failure_semantics.md
docs/security/05_audit_ledger_schema.md
docs/security/06_runtime_enforcement_mapping.md
docs/security/phase_summary.md
docs/security/contribution-threats.md
```

These files are formal security specification companions. They do not replace root-level repository policy.

If a `docs/security/` specification appears to conflict with a root-level policy document, the root-level policy remains the repository-wide authority and the security specification should be updated to align with it.

## Governance process documents

Repository-wide policy is defined by the root-level governance documents.

Detailed process documents for major governance decisions are maintained under:

```text
docs/governance/
```

Start with:

```text
docs/governance/README.md
```

Use:

```text
docs/governance/rfc-process.md
```

when a proposed change affects long-term architecture, authority, public API ownership, validation gates, dependency policy, security process, or project direction.

Use:

```text
docs/governance/decision-record-template.md
```

to record accepted, rejected, superseded, or long-term decisions that must remain reviewable over time.

These documents do not replace `GOVERNANCE.md`, `REVIEW_POLICY.md`, or `CI_VALIDATION_GATES.md`. They provide the process layer for proposals and durable decisions.

## HW subsystem documentation

The HW subsystem documentation is maintained under:

```text
docs/hw/
```

Start with:

```text
docs/hw/README.md
```

The HW documentation defines the hardware authority, platform input boundary, deterministic HW intelligence, signal admission, sensor confidence, capability authorization, pressure reasoning, stability reasoning, runtime snapshot model, decision capsule contract, routing envelope contract, power and thermal authority, evidence custody, validation matrix, integration contracts, and traceability matrix.

The HW documentation is a subsystem specification layer. It does not replace root-level repository policy. Root-level governance, authority, architecture, module-boundary, security, and validation documents remain the repository-wide sources of authority.

The permanent canonical path for the HW documentation set is:

```text
docs/hw/
```

If a future dedicated `hw` repository is created, that repository should link back to this canonical documentation or explicitly state which implementation-local files are code-adjacent companions.

## Repository architecture

At a high level, XPScerpto is organized around layered responsibility:

```text
governance and policy documents
  ↓
build and CI policy
  ↓
base layer
  ↓
platform layer
  ↓
platform.api admitted surface
  ↓
hardware authority layer
  ↓
routing and dispatch layer
  ↓
audit and evidence layer
  ↓
domain execution layers
  ↓
tests, tools, and release evidence
```

Major repository families may include:

- `base` — foundational types, checked primitives, and low-level policy anchors;
- `platform` — platform root, provider admission, runtime policy, and operating boundary;
- `platform.api` — admitted platform-facing surface;
- `hw` — hardware evidence, topology, capability interpretation, and routing support;
- `simd` — authority-routed acceleration and data movement;
- `FHE` — homomorphic encryption, BFV, CKKS, bootstrap, key switching, NTT/RNS, and FHE surface guards;
- `hash`, `kdf`, `mac`, `aead`, `aes` — symmetric cryptographic domains;
- `pqc`, `ed25519`, `x25519`, `rsa` — asymmetric and post-quantum cryptographic domains;
- `number`, `atomic`, `memory`, `integrity` — support layers for arithmetic, synchronization, memory, and integrity behavior;
- `audit` — evidence, ledgers, and attestation-related behavior;
- `tests` — validation, regression, negative tests, authority tests, and sanitizer-backed testing;
- `tools` — scans, replay utilities, evidence support, and CI helpers;
- `docs` — normative and explanatory documentation, including subsystem specification layers such as `docs/hw/`.

This map describes architectural role, not production-readiness status.

## Protected surfaces

The following areas are protected by default:

```text
include/xps/crypto/base/
include/xps/crypto/platform/
include/xps/crypto/platform.api/
include/xps/crypto/hw/
include/xps/crypto/simd/
include/xps/crypto/FHE/
include/xps/crypto/hash/
include/xps/crypto/kdf/
include/xps/crypto/mac/
include/xps/crypto/aead/
include/xps/crypto/aes/
include/xps/crypto/pqc/
include/xps/crypto/ed25519/
include/xps/crypto/x25519/
include/xps/crypto/rsa/
include/xps/crypto/number/
include/xps/crypto/atomic/
include/xps/crypto/memory/
include/xps/crypto/integrity/
include/xps/crypto/audit/
CMakeLists.txt
tests/
tools/
docs/
docs/hw/
.github/
```

Changes to protected surfaces require clear scope, appropriate review, and evidence.

Protected surfaces must not be changed through hidden shortcuts, weakened tests, deleted assertions, fake fallbacks, metadata-only proofs, or production overclaims.

## Build and validation

Build and validation details may vary by platform, compiler, generator, and configured options.

Use the repository’s current build system and CI documentation as the source of truth for commands. When reporting build or test results, include the exact commands and scope.

Validation claims should identify:

- source tree or commit;
- compiler and version;
- CMake version;
- generator;
- build configuration;
- commands executed;
- tests run;
- sanitizer configuration and runtime status, if claimed;
- failures or skipped tests;
- exact blocker, if incomplete.

Do not report a validation claim without enough evidence to support it.

## Security

Do not report vulnerabilities through public issues, pull requests, discussions, public website forms, or social media posts.

Use:

```text
SECURITY.md
```

for vulnerabilities and security-sensitive reports.

Security-sensitive topics include:

- secret key or private key exposure;
- seed, token, credential, or secret material leakage;
- cryptographic correctness failures with security impact;
- authority bypasses;
- platform or provider bypasses;
- unauthorized hardware routing or SIMD dispatch;
- memory safety findings in protected paths;
- CI, evidence, or release manipulation;
- documentation claims that could mislead users about security or readiness.

If unsure whether an issue is security-sensitive, treat it as security-sensitive.

## Support

For non-security questions, use:

```text
SUPPORT.md
```

Support topics may include:

- build help;
- installation help;
- non-security bug reports;
- documentation clarification;
- test execution questions;
- contribution workflow questions.

Do not include secrets, private keys, tokens, exploit details, private data, or active vulnerability reproduction steps in public support channels.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome when they are clear, scoped, and evidence-backed.

Before contributing, read:

```text
CONTRIBUTING.md
REVIEW_POLICY.md
MODULE_BOUNDARIES.md
CI_VALIDATION_GATES.md
SECURITY.md
```

A pull request should explain:

- what changed;
- why it changed;
- which surfaces are affected;
- whether protected surfaces are touched;
- whether the change is security-sensitive;
- what tests were run;
- what evidence supports the claim;
- what was not run;
- what blockers remain;
- what claims are not being made.

Do not open a public pull request with vulnerability details unless disclosure has been coordinated under `SECURITY.md`.

## Ownership and review routing

Ownership policy is defined in:

```text
OWNERSHIP_MODEL.md
```

GitHub review routing is implemented by:

```text
CODEOWNERS
```

`CODEOWNERS` is platform-specific. It routes review requests in GitHub. It does not replace the platform-neutral ownership policy or the review discipline defined in `REVIEW_POLICY.md`.

A change may have the required owners and still be rejected if it violates governance, authority, boundaries, validation, evidence, or claim discipline.

## Claim boundaries

The following kinds of claims require evidence from the relevant gates:

- production-ready;
- production-grade;
- deployment-ready;
- full graph passed;
- sanitizer clean;
- security hardened;
- fully validated;
- release accepted;
- subsystem accepted;
- FHE accepted;
- CKKS accepted;
- BFV accepted;
- bootstrap complete;
- full runtime closure;
- full materialization closure.

Equivalent or stronger claims are also covered.

Do not make these claims unless the relevant acceptance gate proves them through live evidence.

## License

See:

```text
LICENSE_STATUS.md
```

License status: not yet selected.

XPScerpto is currently published for review, evaluation, and project visibility only. No permission is granted to use, copy, modify, redistribute, sublicense, or commercially deploy the code unless a formal license is later published or written permission is granted by the project owner.

## Final note

XPScerpto should be evaluated as a governed cryptographic infrastructure system.

Its credibility depends on alignment between:

```text
implementation
authority
tests
evidence
documentation
claims
```

The project advances only when those dimensions describe the same truth.
